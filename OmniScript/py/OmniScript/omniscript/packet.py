    """The Packet class has packet information.
    The 
    :func:`get_packets() 
    <omniscript.capture.Capture.get_packets>`
    function returns a list of Packet objects.

    Packet number vs index: the packet number, which starts at 0, is a counter of
    the packets as they are captured. When a packet is captured the packet counter
    becomes the packet number of the packet and then the packet counter is incremented.
    The packet index is the index into the list of packets called the packet buffer.
    The first index in the packet buffer is 0. The first packet in the packet buffer,
    index 0, always contains the packet with the lowest packet number.
    
    A capture buffer can only hold a finite number of packets. Once the buffer 
    has filled and a new packet is captured then the first packet in the packet buffer
    (index 0) is deleted makeing what was the second packet (index 1) into the first
    packet (index 0). And the newly captured packet becomes the last packet in the buffer.

    The first_packet attribute of a :class:`Capture <omniscript.capture.Capture>` is
    the packet number of the first packet in the capture buffer.
