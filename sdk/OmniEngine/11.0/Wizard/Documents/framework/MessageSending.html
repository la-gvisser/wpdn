    <h3 class="breakNone">The Plugin Message Sending Process</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        Plugin messaging is used when it is necessary for a plugin to communicate
        information across the network between its console (Omnipeek) instance
        and its engine (Engine) instance. A “plugin message” is the package
        of data that is exchanged between the plugin instances across the network. This
        package of data may include any type of data that needs to be communicated. The
        data is marshaled into a stream and sent by the underlying plugin framework.
        The message functions presented in this topic are in support of this process.
    </p>
    <h3 class="breakNone">Message Options</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        “Message options” refers to the data definition as it is expressed in the
        <b>CMessageOptions</b> class. Message options allow for a single expression of
        the data that is shared by the plugin's console instance code and the engine instance
        plugin code. This process simplifies defining and using the data, as well as
        easily positioning it so the framework can perform the marshaling. Message
        Options are analogous to Preferences (Options) in the way data is handled from
        a single shared definition.
    </p>
    <h3 class="breakNone">The Omni Message</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        The <b>CMessageOptions</b> class (just described above) that the developer uses to
        define plugin message data actually inherits from the <b>COmniMessage</b> class.
        COmniMessage exposes methods for marshaling and unmarshaling the data on
        behalf of the sending and receiving functions. Note that COmniMessage in
        turn inherits from COmniDataModeler (discussed in a separate topic), which
        provides the data modeling functionality. In addition to this provision for
        the packaging of modeled data, COmniMessage adds the ability to package u
        nstructured, i.e. binary, data. Depending on the needs of a plugin, the
        developer can choose modeled data, binary data, or both together, in an
        Omni Message.
    </p>
    <h3 class="breakNone">The Message Options Functionality is Optional</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        The message packaging functionality as offered via CMessageOptions is an
        optional means of creating plugin messages. The plugin message sending
        and receiving functions use data streams as their arguments and developers
        are free to do their own packaging into streams. CMessageOptions and its
        parent classes, which read from and write to streams, are tools which can
        be very helpful to ease this process.
    </p>
    <h3 class="breakNone">Plugin Message Sending and Receiving Methods </h3>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        Plugin messages are initiated with <b>DoSendPluginMessage</b> and they are processed
        by <b>OnProcessPluginMessage</b>. Both methods as mentioned use streams in their
        arguments to encapsulate the data. The stream argument is in the form of a
        reference to the <a href="COmniStream.html">COmniSteam</a> class.
    </p>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        <b>
            <i>
                It is important to note that a plugin message exchange must be initiated
                from the console (i.e. OmniPeek) plugin instance:  DoSendPluginMessage cannot
                be invoked from the engine side.
            </i>
        </b>
        When a message is sent via DoSendPluginMessage in a console side plugin instance, its 
        correlate plugin class on the engine side will receive the message in the 
        OnProcessPluginMessage method. OnProcessPluginMessage on the engine side receives the 
        message in a COmniStream “in” argument, decodes it, and then packages a reply into a 
        COmniStream “out” argument. The final part of the message exchange is when the console
        side plugin instance that had originally initiated the message receives the reply via 
        an OnProcessPluginMessage call on the console side.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:5px">
        Following are the three message sending and receiving methods, shown in order of
        occurrence. Each method definition is followed by a brief description of the
        method, then the arguments as bullet items:

        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="breakBeforeL">Where in the Framework the Sending and Receiving Methods are Called</h3>

    <div style="margin-left:15px">
        <p class="breakNone" style="margin-top:5px"><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DoSendPluginMessage</b> (console side)</p>
        <p class="breakNone" style="margin-left:21px;">
            The sending function DoSendPluginMessage may be called from either the single (root) class
            <b>C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;Plugin</b> or the console side class
            <b>C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;ConsoleContext</b>. The developer may implement this call
            from within any method that is a member of either of the two classes just noted.
        </p>
        <p class="breakNone" style="margin-top:5px">
            <b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OnProcessPluginMessage</b>
            (engne side)
        </p>
        <p class="breakNone" style="margin-left:21px;">
            On the engine side the OnProcessPluginMessage method will be invoked by the system whenever
            the message sent from the console side has been received. The function will be located
            either in the single (root)
            <b>C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;Plugin</b> class or in the
            <b>C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;EngineContext</b> class. The OnProcessPluginMessage function
            will have an incoming COmniStream argument that contains the message. Then, the outgoing
            COmniStream argument needs to be formatted with the reply message.
        </p>
        <p class="breakNone" style="margin-top:5px">
            <b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OnProcessPluginMessage</b>
            (console side)
        </p>
        <p class="breakNone" style="margin-left:21px;">
            Back on the console side again, the OnProcessPluginMessage method will be invoked
            when the engine side reply message is received. This will be in either the single
            (root) class <b>C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;Plugin</b> or the console side class
            <b>C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;ConsoleContext</b>. The message will be delivered
            in the incoming COmniStream argument.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h6 class="breakAfterS" style="margin-top:1px">CMessageOptions Description and Implementation</h6>

    <p class="breakAfterS">
        As noted, the CMessageOptions set of classes exist as an optional means of packaging data
        for plugin message sending.  The reason that expressing data in this way is of great benefit
        is that one data definition and one expression of the structured data is shared by a sending
        class and its correlate receiving class. The data for both sides of any given send/receive
        interaction is defined only once.
    </p>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        CMessageOptions itself is essentially a virtual class and is not implemented for the plugin
        development. The derived classes CPluginMessageOptions and CContextMessageOptions are the
        ones that are actually used for defining message data and modeling it.
    </p>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        CMessageOptions and its derived classes are not framework classes (although they derive from
        framework classes) and thus exist on behalf of the developer. They certainly may be altered
        as necessary to support the needs of the plugin design. It might be, for example, that a
        plugin needs to send multiple messages from one context to another. This in turn may
        require more CMessageOptions-derived classes and/or additional methods within the classes.
        Also, a complex means of determining which data definition goes with which message,
        presumably based on an identifier, may be required. So, while the delivered structure
        provides a very good start point, the developer is free to modify the class in any way that
        befits the plugin design.
    </p>

    <h3 class="breakBeforeL">The Instantiation of CPluginMessageOptions and CContextMessageOptions</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        The instantiation of the CPluginMessageOptions and CContextMessageOptions is already provided
        by the provided wizard code as member variables. No further instantiation of these classes
        is necessary in plugin development unless some complex design requires it. Following shows
        how the message options are instantiated as the member variable m_MsgOpts by the code created
        delivered from the plugin wizard:
    </p>
    <p class="breakNone">
        In the <b>C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;Plugin</b> class class the member variable is defined as:
    </p>
    <p class="codeI0" style="margin:1px 0px 8px 5px;">CPluginMessageOptions &nbsp;&nbsp;m_MsgOpts;</p>
    <p class="breakNone">
        In the <b>C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;ConsoleContext</b> and the
        <b>C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;EngineContext</b> classes class the member variable is defined as:
    </p>
    <p class="codeI0" style="margin:1px 0px 8px 5px;">CContextMessageOptions &nbsp;&nbsp;m_MsgOpts;</p>
    <p class="breakNone">
        Usage of the m_MsgOpts variable within the single plugin class (shared by console and engine)
        or within the console and engine context classes creates the very straightforward means of
        implementing plugin message sending.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h6 class="breakAfterS">COmniMessage Description and Implementation</h6>
    <p class="breakNone">
        The COmniMessage class is a framework class that provides to CMessageOptions the
        functionality for packaging data for message sending. COmniMessage derives from
        COmniDataModeler in order to facilitate data modeling. To this, the COmniMessage class
        adds additional support for unstructured (binary) data. Either structured or unstructured
        data, or both together, may be packaged via COmniMessage.
    </p>
    <h3 class="breakBeforeL">COmniMessage Implementation for Structured and Unstructured Data</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        On the console side, in preparation for a data send, COmniMessage creates the initial
        “package” of data. The packaged data is released (stored) into a stream which is passed
        as an argument to DoSendPluginMessage. On the receiving side COmniMessage parses the
        data back into the structured and/or unstructured members from which it was sent.
    </p>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        The structuring of data is the modeling process as described under the COmniDataModeler
        topic. This rich methodology allows for even very complex data descriptions, including
        many data types, nesting, and repeating of data elements.
    </p>
    <p class="breakNone">
        The support for unstructured data simply involves passing into the COmniMessage methods
        a UInt8* data pointer and a length. Any further elaboration of the data must be performed
        by the person implementing the class. This might be, for example, packing and unpacking
        a <a href="CPacket.html">CPacket</a>, or anything else of interest.
    </p>

        Detail of the Overall Process for Implementing Message Sending in a
        Plugin

            <li style="margin-top:6px">
                A <b>plugin-to-plugin</b> exchange occurs when a message is sent from the single
                <b>C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;Plugin</b> class on the console side. If sent by this class it
                will also be received by the engine side in the same <b>C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;Plugin</b>
                class. One use of plugin-to-plugin messaging is when a plugin is first initializing
                and wants to perform a validation. An example might be the console plugin requesting
                a verification that the engine side instance is listening, and if so to send back
                its version number.

            </li>EngineContext</b> class on
            the engine side. Note that each context represents a capture session. If there are multiple
            simultaneous captures at play, the system will make sure that the context instance
            that receives a message on the engine side is the same as the instance on the console
            side that sent the message.

        </p>
        <p class="breakAfterS" style="margin-left:18px;">
            Data types should be designed such as CStrings for text, integer types, and so on.
            The decision to use data modeling can be made if this would expedite the expression
            of data. If the data is more easily expressed simply as “binary”, then this would be
            the decision. And of course the two can be combined.
        </p>
        <p class="breakAfterS" =" style="margin-left:18px;">
            As an example, it might be realized that a request for data will be sent from the console to
            the engine in response to a user action in a dialog. This would require a request code in
            the send message and a response with code and data both packaged into the message. The
            formatting choice might be an integer expressed in a very simple “model” for the send, and
            a set of data members containing the data modeled as the response. Or alternatively,
            perhaps the response would have an unstructured pointer to the data. This could even be
            related in the developed code to a <a href="CPacket.html">CPacket</a> or some other useful
            piece of data.

        </p>
        <p class="breakAfterS" style="margin-left:18px;">
            The CMessageOptions class has a section for public data items. This is where the data that

            data.
