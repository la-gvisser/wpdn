    <h1>About Engine Plugins</h1><br />
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        A Capture Engine for Omnipeek Analysis Module (an engine plugin) is similar to an Omnipeek
        Analysis Module (a console plugin), but is targeted for the Capture Engine for Omnipeek.
        Like console plugins, engine plugins perform packet filtering and analysis, and may
        function as adapters to supply packets to the engine. An engine plugin is also used by
        Omnipeek to provide the About box, Options (Settings) dialog, engine tab, capture tab and
        packet summary information.
    </p>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>
        The Engine Plugin Wizard provides a framework for the plugin that shields the developer
        from the underlying architecture, life-cycle and protocols of an engine plugin. The
        framework is written in C++ and hides all of the communication with engine. See
        Appendix A: Capture Engine Plugin Interface for a detailed description.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Capture Engine Plugin Framework is similar in concept to the Omnipeek Console Plugin
        Framework. The Plugin and Context classes will be familiar to the plugin developer. But
        the underlying architecture and behavior (protocols) of an engine plugin are dramatically
        different from that of a console plugin, and some of these differences are visible. For
        instance, the console plugin’s CPacket object limited knowledge of the packets structure
        and layers, the engine's CPacket object allows for deep packet inspection. In the
        console plugin framework, all calls to Omnipeek are made with ‘Do’ methods: DoNotify for
        example. In the engine plugin framework a set of service objects are provided. So a
        notification is made via the object’s Notify method.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        The Capture Engine Plugin Framework provides a rich set of objects to assist the developer
        in decoding, filtering, storing and managing packets and conversations
        (flows, streams,… ).<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        An engine plugin is used in two environments: on the Capture Engine and on the Omnipeek
        console. When on the engine, the plugin may filter, process and collect statistics of
        packets. On the console side, the plugin may summarize packets, provide user setting and
        About box dialogs. Alternately the framework allows the developer to create webpages that
        describe the plugin's About box, settings dialog, engine tab and capture tab. When a
        plugin is developed with this methodology the plugin is not installed on Omnipeek. Instead
        Omnipeek will download  the webpages from the engine and display them in Webviews.
    </p>

    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>
        The COmniEngineContext is the primary class of interest to plugin developers. This class
        is only instatiated on the Engine and includes the members: OnFilter, OnProcessPacket, 
        OnProcessTime, OnResetCapture, OnStartCapture and OnStopCapture, among others. These are 
        the work horse member functions of the plugin. An instance of this class is created for 
        each capture created on an Engine.<br />

        The COmniConsoleContext only instantiated in Omnipeek. It is used for several different 
        tasks: a) When the user creates a new capture on an Engine. This context may be used to 
        display the plugin's About and Options dialogs. b) When the user opens a Remote Capture 
        Window. c) When the user selects Capture Options a capture on an Engine.<br />

        The relationship between the Engine and its engine plugins is different than the 
        relationship between Omnipeek and its plugins. Omnipeek loads and initializes the 
        plugin and make calls via a single entry point in the dll (plugin). In an Omnipeek 
        plugin, it is the plugin object that instantiates the context objects. The Engine
        instantiates and initializes instances of the CRemotePlugin object. The engine views these 
        as context objects. It is the framework that instantiates the plugin object (COmniPlugin). 
        And the engine calls to the context only through the interfaces it implements. The context 
        has a reference to the single plugin object and may call the plugin object's methods 
        directly.<br />

        The Engine recongnizes two different types of plugin: Engine Plugins and Peek Plugins. The
        Engine Plugin Wizard creates plugins that implement both types. The Engine instantiates a
        single instance of each Engine Plugin at start up. And a instance of each Peek Plugin when
        a capture context is created. Capture Engine may also create a  second instance of each
        Peek Plugin for each capture context to support Graphing. The Engine will instantiate all
        the Engine Plugins and get their names inorder to build the list of plugins currently on
        the engine. The framework insulates these kinds of behaviors from the developer.<br />

        When Omnipeek connects to an Engine, Omnipeek loads an instance of each Engine Plugin that
        is has installed that are also installed on the Engine. When an Engine's Capture's window
        is opened, Omnipeek creates an instance of each Peek Plugin that is installed on the
        Engine. In order for Omnipeek to instantiate either Engine or Peek Plugins, the Capture
        Engine Plugin must be installed in Omnipeek. For engine plugins that implement HTML or CEF
        Preferences a proxy object is created instead. The proxy object has references to the
        webpages that belong to the engine plugin and will display the webpage when needed.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>Plugin Life Cycle</h2>
    <p>
        The first instance of the Capture Engine Plugin is created during the initialization
        process of the Engine. This is an instance of the Engine Plugin does not have a Context
        Identifier (context id). The framework will create an instance of COmniPlugin. This plugin
        object is shared by all contexts. The framework calls OnInitialize and OnReadPrefs. A note
        on preferences: plugin preferences are currently being used to persist and maintain
        settings that will be used for Forensic Searchs. The framework creates and initializes the
        context. The framework will call OnSetContextPrefs if the engine makes the appropriate
        calls to the framework.<br />

        When the capture is started the framework will call OnReset followed by OnCaptureStarting
        which is called to allow the context to intitialize the private resources it needs to
        capture packets. For example opening a database. Then OnStartCapture is called to signal
        the context that the engine has created and initialized all of its resource for the
        capture and the context can request access to any engine resources it needs. Finaly
        OnCaptureStarted is called and the context should be fully prepared to filter and process
        packets. These calls are optional, if disabled then the engine will not issue the
        corrisponding calls to the framework and hence the framework will not call the context. To
        disable these calls in the file StdAfx.h remove or comment the line:
    </p>
    <p class="codeP">
        <i>#define IMPLEMENT_PACKETPROCESSOREVENTS</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        For an engine plugin to filter packets the user must create an Advanced Filter that
        contains an Analysis Module node with the node configured to the plugin. Then for each
        packet the filter is executed and the Analysis Module node will call the framework which
        will calls OnFilterPacket. And for each packet accepted by the filters the framework calls
        OnProcessPacket. Once a second the framework calls OnProcessTime. And every now and then
        other calls are made.<br />

        When the capture is stopped first OnCaptureStopping is called to signal the context that
        a Stop Capture command was issued. Then OnStopCapture is called to signal the context that
        all the packets have been proccessed. Finally OnCaptureStopped is called to allow the
        context to release the resources it uses while capturing packet. To continue the example
        above, the database is closed. When the capture is deleted,  OnResetCapture and
        OnTerminate are called. The context is then released and the COmniEngineContext is
        destroyed.<br />

        The Framework contains a Context Manager to simplify the life-cycle of the context
        objects. The Capture Engine views Peek Plugins as very light weight objects and thus
        creates, deletes and recreates them when ever the capture's settings are modified... etc.
        The Context Manager holds the COmniEngineContext and COmneConsoleContext objects during
        capture setting modification events. (This is too much detail.)
    </p>

    <h2>Packet Processing</h2>
    <p>
        The OnFilterPacket and OnProcessPacket member functions may need to perform deep packet
        inspection. The  Layers and Headers classes facilitate in decoding packets. The plugin
        calls the GetLayer members of CPacket. The arguments class determines which layer is
        returned. If the resulting layer is not valid (IsNotValid() or !IsValid()) then the packet
        does not contain the requested layer (protocol). <br />

        The CIpLayer and CIpAddress classes support both IPv4 and IPv6. It is best to use these classes
        until you absolutely need the protocol specific classes: CIpV4Layer and the CIpV6Layer. The layer
        classes have interrogation members to retrieve 	and test specific fields of the header. Multi-byte
        fields are returned in the host's native numeric format. All layers provide methods to return
        their underlying header data structures.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ( !inPacket.GetLayer( layerIP ) ) {<br />

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return PEEK_PLUGIN_FAILURE;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return PEEK_PLUGIN_SUCCESS;<br />
        }<br />
    </p>

    <p>
        The classes CIpAddress and CPort combined with the TPair template are used to build up the
        CIpPortPair class. This class contains the IP Address and TCP Port of the source and destination
        of a packet to create a flow/stream/conversation identifier. The comparison and matching methods
        perform cross comparisons to match packets of either direction: client to host or host to client.
        Packets also have a Flow Id that is retrieved via the FlowId method of CPacket.
        <br />

        The data bytes of a packet CPacket object my be either owned by the object (attached) or by another
        object (detached). Copies of CPacket objects maintain their ownership state: a copy of the bytes is
        made for attached packets, and a copy of the reference to the data is made for detached packets. The
        bytes of a packet may be retrieved by either a CByteVectRef or a COmniStream. A CByteVectRef contains
        a pointer to the data and the length of the data and is a safe way to access the bytes of a packet
        without making copies or accessing memory outside of the packet data. A COmniStream has a copy of the
        data and provides Seek and Read operations similar to a file, but at the cost of coping the data.<br />

        The CCaptureBuffer class provides for long term in memory and on file storage of CPacket objects. Peek
        Capture files (.pkt) may be read/loaded into CCaptureBuffer. Additional functionality includes: flushing
        the contents to disk based on file size and age.
        <b>
            Versions of Omni prior to 6.6 contain a defect that causes only about 80% of a packet file (.pkt)
            to be loaded into the capture buffer.
        </b>
        <br />

        The framework uses CGlobalId to wrap the GUID structure. This light-weight class allows for
        uninitialized (-1) and NULL (0) states. It also has a Create method to generate new GUIDs.
