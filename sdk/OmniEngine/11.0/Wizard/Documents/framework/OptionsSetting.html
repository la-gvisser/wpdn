    <h3 class="breakNone">What are Options?</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        Options are the expression of user preferences which are used by a plugin and which
        may be specified by a plugin user via dialogs. Typically options are
        configured using the COptions class and any subordinate classes. COptions as 
        delivered is a shell into which data members, and if necessary additional methods, 
        are added by the developer. There is existing example code that is generated from the 
        wizard which serves to demonstrate how the needed items are added to the class.

    <h3 class="breakNone">Options Implementation in the OmniEngine Plugins</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        Options configuration is really a collaboration between the engine-side
        (OmniEngine) instance of the plugin and the console-side (OmniPeek) instance. 
        Thus a basic requirement is that the plugin be installed on both sides. 
        The dialog(s) used for options specification are created by the plugin under
        OmniPeek, then, when the user accepts any changes (i.e. presses OK), the options
        are sent across the network to the engine side plugin instance. It is on
        the engine side that the options are stored and utilized.
