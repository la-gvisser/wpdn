    <h3 class="breakNone">Packets and Packet Buffers in the OmniEngine</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        Packet buffers as well as packet arrays are available for
        packet storage within the OmniEngine framework code.  The packet buffer available
        from the framework code is internally the same mechanism as used by the
        OmniEngine.
    </p>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        Within the OmniEngine, packet buffers serve as a central
        repository for packets as they flow from the network.  A given capture has a
        buffer which is very closely associated with the capture itself in terms of
        its function and also in terms of its semantics.  The packet buffering methodology
        has been leveraged and extended for use with plugins.  Additionally, the framework
        code has direct access to the engine’s capture buffer.
    </p>

    <h3 class="breakNone">Overview of an OmniEngine Packet Buffer </h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        A packet buffer contains an organization of memory that
        efficiently caches packets as they flow from the network.  This memory space is
        optimized for accumulating and retrieving data in a consecutive (or sequential)
        manner.  A packet’s data, in fact, exists within the context of the packet buffer
        itself, and the packet data really “belongs” to the buffer, not to the packet as
        any independent entity.  Thus the buffer plays a critical role in the capture
        process, and is nearly synonymous with the capture.  Buffer methods include buffer
        size, packet count, a number of packet-related methods (available via packet index),
        and a number of “capture-type” specifics such as start and stop time, media info,
        and so on.
    </p>

    <h3 class="breakNone">Overview of an OmniEngine Packet</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        A “packet” is a class of data and methods that encapsulate
        and make available in a meaningful way the data that has traversed the network as
        a network packet.  This particular document will discuss packets as they relate to
        packet buffers and arrays; an in-depth discussion of packets will be found in
        another document.
    </p>
    <p class="breakNone">
        The important internal elements of a packet that should be
        noted are that there is a header which is a PeekPacket structure and there is a
        pointer to the packet data.  There are additionally a number of methods for
        retrieving such things as the packet’s number within the buffer, its media type,
        its protospec, its timestamp, and so on.  As mentioned above, the data pointer
        within the OmniPeek / OmniEngine packet points directly to a portion of data within
        the buffer which thus is owned by the buffer.  If the buffer were to go out of
        scope the packet data would become invalid (this is a critical thing to note).
    </p>
    <br>

    <h6 class="breakAfterS" style="margin-top:4px">
        Overview of Packet Buffers and the Packet Array Within the Wizard
    </h6>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        The packet and buffer classes offered by the wizard are
        essentially wrappers around interfaces that expose the packet and buffer engine
        classes.  To these internal interface methods a number of useful new methods have
        been added as well.  In fact, the packet and buffer classes as offered by the plugin
        wizard present powerful capabilities that are unique in the ease of their implementation.
    </p>

    <h3 class="breakNone">OmniEngine Classes CPacketBuffer and CDynamicPacketBuffer</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        CPacketBuffer and CDynamicPacketBuffer are the direct wrappers to
        the OmniEngine’s packet buffer interfaces.  The buffer for a given capture is directly
        accessible via the member variables <b>m_PacketBuffer</b> and <b>m_DynamicPacketBuffer</b>
        in the engine context class C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;EngineContext.  Between the
        CPacketBuffer and CDynamicPacketBuffer classes, the necessary functions for engine packet
        buffer access are exposed.
    </p>

    <h3 class="breakNone">Plugin classes CCaptureBuffer, CFileCaptureBuffer, and CPacketArray</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        As noted, the CPacketBuffer and CDynamicPacketBuffer class member
        variables are used when it is needed to directly access a capture’s packet buffer.  However,
        when creating a new repository for caching packets in the plugin, there are three other
        classes (unique to the plugin) that should be used.  These are the <a href="CCaptureBuffer.html">
            CCaptureBuffer
        </a> class,
        its derivative class <a href="CFileCaptureBuffer.html">CFileCaptureBuffer</a>, and the
        <a href="CPacketArray.html">CPacketArray</a> class.  Between these three
        classes, robust capabilities are available to the developer for caching packets by the
        plugin during a capture.
    </p>

    <h3 class="breakNone">CCaptureBuffer</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        The <a href="CCaptureBuffer.html">CCaptureBuffer</a> class internally encapsulates three
        OmniEngine interfaces that together expose powerful packet buffer capabilities.  This class,
        along with the <a href="CFileCaptureBuffer.html">CFileCaptureBuffer</a> class, are the ones that
        should be used when it is desired to efficiently cache packets during a capture.  While a
        complete index of the available methods can be found in the
        <a href="CCaptureBuffer.html">CCaptureBuffer</a> link, this document will highlight
        important concepts and methods.  Important methods include getting and setting the buffer
        size, getting the packet count, reading packets into and out of the buffer, and file
        persistence functionality.
    </p>

    <h3 class="breakNone">CFileCaptureBuffer</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        The <a href="CFileCaptureBuffer.html">CFileCaptureBuffer</a> class extends
        <a href="CCaptureBuffer.html">CCaptureBuffer</a> to further the capability for persisting a
        capture buffer to file.  The <a href="CFileCaptureBuffer.html">CFileCaptureBuffer</a> class
        actually has dual inheritance from <a href="CCaptureBuffer.html">CCaptureBuffer</a> plus a
        class with time and size controlling methods called
        <a href="CRefreshFile.html">CRefreshFile</a> (see following section).  The functionality
        that results from extending both these classes allows automating file persistence based
        on file size and / or time elapsed criteria.  Functionality is also offered for dynamically
        creating meaningful file names that have a start timestamp as part of the name.
    </p>

    <a name="PacketBuffers::RefreshConcept">
        <h3 class="breakNone">The Concept of a Refresh</h3>
    </a>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        To refresh a file such as a
        capture (.pkt) file simply means to close the capture file that is currently being used for
        persistence to disk and to create and open a new file to continue the process.  The new file
        will also have a new name.  A typical file name will have a base name plus a formatted time
        string, although other naming algorithms are available.
    </p>

    <h3 class="breakNone">CRefreshFile</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        The <a href="CRefreshFile.html">CRefreshFile</a> class offers the methods concerned with
        refreshing a file (see above topic).  This class does not function
        in a standalone context (it has some virtual functions), but is used in the inheritance
        hierarchy for such classes as <a href="CFileCaptureBuffer.html">CFileCaptureBuffer</a> to
        give it robust packet file naming and managing capability.
    </p>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        <a href="CRefreshFile.html">CRefreshFile</a> presents (for CFileCaptureBuffer use)
        the following triggers for the refresh action:  (1) establishing a file size maximum ,
        (2) a time elapsed limit, or (3) both together (i.e. whichever trigger occurs first).
    </p>

    <h3 class="breakNone">CPacketArray</h3>
    <p class="breakNone">
        The <a href="CPacketArray.html">CPacketArray</a> class inherits from CAtlArray to
        provide a more flexible, but perhaps less efficient during real time processing,
        repository for <a href="CPacket.html">CPackets</a> .  With this, packets may be easily
        added or inserted, accessed, or deleted.  There is also a method for building a packet
        array from a capture buffer or file capture buffer.
    </p>
    <br>

    <a name="PacketBuffers::AttachedDetached">
        <h6 class="breakAfterS" style="margin-top:1px">
            Attached and Detached Packets and the Implications for Copying
        </h6>
    </a>

    <p class="breakAfterL">
        There is an inherent issue regarding <a href="CPacket.html">CPackets</a> that are cached during
        a capture session.  This is that their data, as discussed above, belongs to a packet buffer
        and not to the packet itself.  This situation is not safe for anything more than temporary
        work with a packet because it is not known if or when the OmniEngine might reorganize its data
        store or even delete it.  If this were to happen, the CPacket’s internal data pointer would
        become invalid, and this event would not be known!  It was thus necessary to add support to
        the plugin’s <a href="CPacket.html">CPacket</a> class for safely circumventing this situation.
        In order to understand and utilize the added functionality, the concepts of attached and
        detached packets need to be understood.
    </p>

    <h3 class="breakNone">Attached Packets</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        The OmniEngine has no explicit concept of attached packets because there
        is only one status of a packet, and this is what we refer to as “attached”.  The “attached”
        reference to a packet simply means that its data is owned by a buffer.  Thus all packets
        received from the OmniEngine during a capture are attached, since that is the only status of
        an engine packet.  In the same way, all packets read out from a CPacketBuffer object via the
        GetPacket() method are attached to the buffer from which they were read.  This applies as well
        to the CCaptureBuffer and CFileCaptureBuffer classes.  In the same way, any packet read out
        from CCaptureBuffer and CFileCaptureBuffer type objects via the GetPacket() method are attached
        packets.
    </p>

    <h3 class="breakNone">Detached Packets</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        The concept of a detached packet has been added on behalf of needed
        functionality for the plugin.  Detaching a packet involves allocating new memory storage for
        the data portion of the packet and copying the data over into that new storage.  Thus the detached
        packet’s data is completely decoupled from the parent buffer and is safe from any changes to the
        buffer.  Internally a detached packet’s data uses a shared pointer, allowing the packet to be
        further copied efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3 class="breakNone">Detaching and Copying Packets</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        When a <a href="CPacket.html">CPacket</a> is copied, then by default only its data pointers are
        actually copied, not the data itself.  This means that a copy of an attached CPacket has its data
        owned by a buffer, just as did the source CPacket.  However, the CPacket class contains a method
        called “Detach()” that will allocate new memory to hold the data in a shared data pointer.  If
        the now-detached packet is copied then the shared data pointer’s reference count will be
        incremented via a method that is similar to AddRef.
    </p>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        The important thing to note is that detached packets are safe to use for as
        long as is necessary by in the plugin since any dependency on a packet buffer has been removed.
    </p>

        <b>Refresh</b> is the method that explicitly causes the flushing to disk and closing the current
        capture file so that a new file will be created.  <b>RefreshIfTimeExpired</b> does as its name implies: it triggers a
        refresh if the specified time interval has elapsed.  <b>CheckRefresh</b> covers the whole thing as it tests for file size
        maximum and then time expired.  If necessary it then calls Refresh.
    </p>
    <p class="breakBeforeS" style="font-style:italic">
        Note, however, that none of the above three functions typically needs
        to be explicitly called by the user code called because the CFileCaptureBuffer implementation of WritePacket
        calls CheckRefresh before the current packet is written to disk.  Then, at end of the process, Deactivate causes a
        final flush to disk by calling Refresh.

    <h6 class="breakAfterS" style="margin-top:4px">CPacketArray Methods</h6>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        CPacketArray derives from CAtlArray, so the default functions such as “GetAt” apply.  The methods
        that have been added in order to extend the functionality are clearly implicit in the function names.  AddPacket
        adds packets to the end of the array, InsertPacket adds a packet at a position (index), ReplacePacket replaces the
        packet at a position, RemovePacket removes the packet at a position , and GetPacket returns a CPacket from the
        specified position.

        This function builds a new packet array composed of the entire contents of a capture buffer.
        Note that the first argument can refer either to a CCaptureBuffer object or to a CFileCaptureBuffer object.  The
        function will remove any existing contents of the packet array before loading the packets.

    <h3 class="breakNone">Copy:</h3>

    </table>
    <p class="breakBeforeS">
        The Copy function copies an entire packet array from an input array.  Any existing packets in
        the destination (calling) array are removed prior to copying.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3 class="breakAfterS">The Detach Parameter</h3>
    <p class="breakAfterS">
        A number of the packet array functions have a parameter called “bDetach”.  bDetach is always a default
        parameter with the default value of “false”.  If a given function is invoked with a bDetach argument of “true”,
        then the CPacket being passed into or out of the function will be guaranteed to be detached.  What this really means
        is that if the CPacket is attached then the detach method will be invoked.  However, if the packet is already
        detached then there will be no need for this, so the Detach method will not be called.
    </p>
    <p class="breakAfterL">
        The other clear implication is that if the bDetach argument is not called (or it is called
        explicitly with a value of false), then the CPacket will keep its current state, either attached or detached.
        Since “attached” and “detached” are packet specific, it is possible that a packet array will have all attached
        packets, all detached packets, or mixed attached and detached.

    <h3 class="breakNone">Sample Code in Engine Context File Generated by the Wizard</h3>
    <p class="breakNone">
        If “Include sample code” was selected on the initial wizard screen then some very informative
        code samples pertaining to capture buffers, file capture buffers, and packet arrays is included.  However, to activate
        this code you must include a macro that has been commented out.  Toward the top of the engine context header file
        C&lt;<i>plugin name</i>&gt;EngineContext.h) the following line needs to be uncommented before compiling:
    </p>
    <p class="breakAfterL" style="font:12px Courier New;color:green">
        //#define EXAMPLE_FILECAPTUREBUFFER
    </p>

    <ol class="breakAfterL">
        <li class="breakAfterS">
            The example code demonstrates how a sample capture file can be specified along with refresh
            triggering criteria.  Whenever the OnProcessPacket method receives a CPacket this packet is written into a file
            capture buffer.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <b>ExampleBufferOperations</b> function shows a number of ways that a packet can be put into and taken out of
            capture buffers, file capture buffers, and packet arrays.  There are ASSERTs to demonstrate that, for example,
            a copy has resulted in an identical packet or that the attached or detached state is as expected.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="breakNone">Example Code To Demonstrate How “Attach” and “Detach” Are Involved</h3>

    <p class="codeG">// Load packets into MyFileBuffer – see example code in the wizard</p>

    <p class="breakAfterL" style="margin-left:5px">
        This results in a packet array with all detached packets.  Each packet in the array now owns
        its data.  However, this is via a shared data pointer, so any further “detaching” of the data will only increment
        the data pointer’s reference count.
